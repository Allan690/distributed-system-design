    "For the sake of this problem, we'll focus on Amazon's retail business where users can buy/sell products.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements and Goals of the System\n",
    "1. Users should be able to:\n",
    "    - Add new products to sell.\n",
    "    - Search products by name or category.\n",
    "    - Buy products only if they are registered members.\n",
    "    - Remove/modify product items in their shopping cart.\n",
    "    - Checkout and buy items in the shopping cart.\n",
    "    - Rate and review a product.\n",
    "    - Specify a shipping address where their order will be delivered.\n",
    "    - Cancel and order if it hasn't been shipped.\n",
    "    - Pay via debit or credit cards\n",
    "    - Track their shipment to see the current state of their order.\n",
    "2. The system should be able to:\n",
    "    - Send a notification whenever the shipping status of the order changes."

    "## Use Case Diagram\n",
    "We have four main actors in the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Admin:** Mainly responsible for account management, adding and modifying new product categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Guest:** All guests can search the catalog, add/remove items on the shopping cart, and also become registered members.\n",
    "- **Member:** In addition to what guests can do, members can place orders and add new products to sell\n",
    "- **System:** Mainly responsible for sending notifications for orders and shipping updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Top use cases therefore include:\n",
    "1. Add/Update products: whenever a product is added/modified, update the catalog.\n",
    "2. Search for products by their name or category.\n",
    "3. Add/remove product items from shopping cart.\n",
    "4. Checkout to buy a product item in the shopping cart.\n",
    "5. Make a payment to place an order.\n",
    "6. Add a new product category.\n",
    "7. Send notifications about order shipment updates to members. \n"
