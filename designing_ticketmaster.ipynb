    "## 1. Requirements and System goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements\n",
    "- The service should list different cities where its affiliated cinemas are located.\n",
    "- When user selects a city, the service should display movies released in that particular city.\n",
    "- When user selects movie, the service should display the cinemas running the movie plus available show times.\n",
    "- Users should be able to book a show at a cinema and book tickets.\n",
    "- The service should be able to show the user the seating arrangement of the cinema hall. The user should be able to select multiple seats according to the preference.\n",
    "- The user should be able to distinguish between available seats from booked ones.\n",
    "- Users should be able to put a hold on the seat (for 5 minutes) while they make payments.\n",
    "- Users should be able to wait if there is a chance that the seats might become available (When holds by other users expire).\n",
    "- Waiting customers should be serviced in a fair, first come, first serve manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "- The service should be highly concurrent. There will be multiple booking requests for the same seat at any particular point in time. \n",
    "- The system has financial transactions, meaning it should be secure and the DB should be ACID compliant.\n",
    "- Assume traffic will spike on popular/much-awaited movie releases and the seats would fill up pretty fast, so the service should be highly scalable and highly available to keep up with the surge in traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Considerations\n",
    "1. Assume that our service doesn't require authentication.\n",
    "2. No handling of partial ticket orders. Either users get all the tickets they want or they get nothing.\n",
    "3. Fairness is mandatory.\n",
    "4. To prevent system abuse, restrict users from booking more than 10 seats at a time."

    "- if the required number of seats become available, take the user to theatre page to choose seats\n",

    "#### How do we keep track of all active reservations  that haven't been booked yet? and also keep track of waiting customers?\n",
    "We need two daemon services:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Active Reservation Service**\n",
    "\n",
    "This will keep track of all active reservations and remove expired ones from the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can keep all the reservations of a show in memory in a [Linked Hashmap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linkedhashmap-class-java-examples/), in addition to also keeping data in the DB. \n",
    "- We will need this doubly-linked data structure to jump to any reservation position to remove it when the booking is complete. \n",
    "- The head of the HashMap will always points to the oldest record, since we will have expiry time associated with each reservation. The reservation can be expired when the timeout is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "To store every reservation for every show, we can have a HashTable where the `key` = `ShowID` and `value` = Linked HashMap containing `BookingID` and creation `Timestamp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the DB, \n",
    "- we store reservation in the `Booking` table\n",
    "- expiry time will be in the Timestamp column. \n",
    "- The `Status` field will have a value of `Reserved(1)` and, as soon as a booking is complete, update the status to `Booked(2)`\n",
    "    - After status is changed, remove the reservation record from Linked HashMap of the relevant show. \n",
    "- When reservation expires, remove it from the Booking table or mark it `Expired(3)`, and remove it from memory as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "ActiveReservationService will work with the external Financial service to process user payments. When a booking is completed, or a reservation expires, WaitingUserService will get a signal so that any waiting customer can be served.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "- This service will keep track of waiting users in a Linked HashMap or TreeMap.\n",
    "- To help us jump to any user in the list and remove them when they cancel the request.\n",
    "- Since it's a first-come-first-served basis, the head of the Linked HashMap would always point to the longest waiting user, so that whenever seats become available, we can serve users in a fair manner.\n",

    "We'll have a HashTable to store all waiting users for every show. \n",
    "    Key = `ShowID`, value = `Linked HashMap containing UserIDs and their  start-time`\n",
    "    \n",
    "Clients can use Long Polling to keep themselves updated for their reservation status. Whenever seats become available, the server can use this request to notify the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reservation Expiration\n",
    "On the server, the Active Reservation Service keeps track of expiry of active connections (based on reservation time). \n",
    "\n",
    "On the client, we will show a timer (for expiration time), which could be a little out of sync with the server. We can add a buffer of 5 seconds on the server to prevent the client from ever timing out after the server, which, if left unchecked, could prevent successful purchase. \n"
