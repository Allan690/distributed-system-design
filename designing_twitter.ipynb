    "# Designing Twitter\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter is an online social networking service where users post and read short 140-character messages called \"tweets\". Registered Users can post and read tweets, but those not registered can only read them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Requirements and System Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Functional Requirements\n",
    "1. Users should be able to post new tweets.\n",
    "2. A user should be able to follow other users.\n",
    "3. Users should be able to mark tweets as favorites.\n",
    "4. Tweets can contain photos and videos.\n",
    "5. A user should have a timeline consting of top tweets from all the people the user follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-functional Requirements\n",
    "1. Our service needs to be highly available.\n",
    "2. Acceptance latency of the sytstem is 200ms for timeline generation.\n",
    "3. Consistency can take a hit (in the interest of availability); if user doesn't see a tweet for a while, it should be fine."
