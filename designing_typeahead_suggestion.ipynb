    "As the user types into the search box, it tries to predict the query based on the characters the users has entered, and gives a list of suggestions to complete the query.\n",

    "The problem to solve is that we have a lot of strings we need to store in such a way that the user can search with any prefix. The service will suggest the terms that match with the prefix. For example, if our DB contains the terms (cat, cap, captain, capital), and the user has typed in `cap`, then the system should suggest `cap`, `captain` and `capital`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To serve a lot of queries with minimal latency, we can't depend on the DB for this; we need to store our index in memory in a highly efficient data structure â€“ a Trie(pronounced \"try\").\n",
