    "## What's a Web Crawler?\n",
    "It's a software program which browses the WWW in a methodical and automated manner, collecting documents by recursively fetching links from a set of starting pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search engines use web crawling as a means to provide up-to-date data. Search engines download all pages and create an index on them to perform faster searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other uses of web crawlers:\n",
    "- Test web pages and links for valid syntax and structure.\n",
    "- To search for copyright infringements.\n",
    "- To maintain mirror sites for popular web sites.\n",
    "- To monitor sites to see where their content changes.\n",
